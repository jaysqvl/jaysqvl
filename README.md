Hello!

I'm Jay Esquivel, a second year undergraduate currently studying at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.

Currently exploring the depths of mobile and web development but love coding software that improves the lives of many!

My most comfortable languages are Java and Python but I love broadening my knowledge. Always willing to learn a new language.
